*Session 3 Notes*

The party started in their dilapidated inn, **Trollskull Manor**, when a knock started at the door, a Dwarven man named **Broxley Fairkettle** _[1]_ lets him self in and introduces himself to the party as a Member of the Fellowship of the innkeepers. He asks them if they plan on getting the Inn back on its feet, and says it'll probably cost them a solid 1,250gp. He offered a loan of 2000gp, providing the fellowship take 10% from the Inn's profit. The party agreed to his loan, and Broxley left. Shortly after Broxley left a small *Paper Bird* flew through one of the broken windows of the manor. It landed at the feet of Flank, who unfolded it and read a message from the Harpers:

>Ranaer tells us you guys are a good bet. He brought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at the Intermission. Private Box C. Formal Attire is required for Admittance.

The party decided this is the only plot point they have right now so might as well go. As they're leaving the manor, a group of bards and minstrels are playing outside of the manor, and they give a nod to the party as they go to leave. B assumes the guy is an idiot as he keeps calling him "Guvna", when B is not a noble in any sense of the word. The party heads over to the Sea Ward, to the **Golden Stitching** and get some fancy clothes tailored up ready to go, though needing a rush job is not cheap, and cost the party 150 gold each. After waiting for the tailors to tailor, the party heads back to the Manor to get changed and head over to the opera.

Upon arriving back at Trollskull Manor there were four dudes already in the manor, B seemed alarmed until Flank and Henry calmed him down, saying they're here to fix our shit. The cook the fellowship had sent over was already annoyed at the lack cooking utensils, and that the kitchen was just in a shit state. The party said they'd help get it fixed up, but they had other business to attend to, *The Opera!* For some reason Peet thought he should tag along too, why not, yolo etc. etc.

Upon arriving at the Opera, the party turns up to the box office and says that Renaer had put some tickets aside from themselves. The woman lets the party in, Henry then says "Oh, that weird chef is with us too, you know, they don't have it easy." The woman working the counter replies "Who, chefs? I've heard its not easy." The party heads on up to Box C, which is currently empty, lets themselves in and starts enjoying the opera, The Fall Of Tiamat _[2]_. When the intermission starts a voice pipes up from behind the party, "Well, hello lads, I assume you're Renaer's acquaintances?" The man then introduces himself as **Mirt** - Mirt is a high ranking member of the Harpers, who specializes in intrigue, and he takes a keen interest in people who show promise and are able to use their heads. He invites the party to attempt a mission for him, find a talking mare (possible zebra/large husky, tbc) named **Maxeene**. Maxeene often pulls carriages across the city, as any other horse would, as to not draw too much attention to herself. The information Mirt is after is, has Maxeene learned the identity of any Zhent operatives, and if so, determine their whereabouts. He agreed to pay the party 40 gold pieces each of they manage to pull this off. On the carriage ride back to Trollskull manor, the party gets talking to their cabbie, who says Maxeene apparently is known to mostly take fares around the Castle Ward, though he doesn't head down that far and normally sticks to the sea ward.

The party heads down to the castle ward, and the keen eye'd Flank instantly spots a carridge being pulled by a horse matching Maxeene's description, and decide to take a fair back to trollskull, acting casually trying to bait Maxeene into talking. Eventually the party finds out that Maxeene had transported a few Zhents recently, A sun elf and a Half Orc with dummy thicc thighs. Maxeene can't remember where she picked them up, however she does remember dropping them off at the Yawning Portal 2 nights ago. They were speaking about hiring spies to root out Xanathar Guild hideouts across the city. The party heads over to Mirt's Mansion in the Sea Ward and collects their reward.

The party goes back to Trollskull Manor to get some sleep. The next morning, the party are just relaxing and chilling out in their slightly less shitty than before Inn, when suddenly the windows rattle as the roar of an explosion fills Trollskull Alley. Charred bodies and anguished screams fly through the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast, which occured right outside the manor's front door. The three members on the ground floor, B, Peet and Flank all rush outside, and Peet begins to look over the charred remains. There is a Male Gnome, wearing a burned cloack and is clutching a dagger, two female humans and one male half-elf dressed in plain clothes. Two clocked male humans clad in leather armor with sheathed longswords, and the group of 5 bards and minstrels who had been playing outside of the Manor previously. Peet quickly investigates and notices on one of the dead male humans, there is a black winged snake tattoo'd on his forearm. The dead Gnome has dry "waste" on his boots and cloak, and he had a pouch containing 5 gemstones, however as everybody was looking at the scene of the explosion, Peet decided to not steal it. 

Flank then decides to start asking people what they saw, firstly he approached Fala, Owner of Corellon's Crown, who says:
>I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Luckily I wasn't injured! Through the smoke I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of the dead gnome and start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.

The party then headed across to the bent nail to question Tally, the owner, however as far as they could tell, he wasn't lying when he said he hadn't seem anybody coming this way, and he seemed relieved none of you were hurt.

Flank and Henry head back across to see if there are any other witnesses, by this time the Watch has arrived, blocking both northern entrances and the southern entrance both in and out of Trollskull alley. Flank spots another person who may have seen something, they had just left the Tiger's Eye as the explosion happened.

>I tell you, it was nor a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop and it hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!

Flank knows this to be a Nimblewright, a construct commonly used by his church 

Finally a small 12 year old also tells flank he saw the explosion too, and that he hid for cover behind a water butt after the explosion, and while hiding he heard a *plop* sound and when he looked in he found a necklace with two orange beads, and a broken clasp floating inside. He hands it to flank, who then offered the small boy a beer.

While Flank and Henry were interviewing, B and Peet decided to try slipping down into the sewer, however the noise of them lifting the cover and trying to slip in had alerted the guards. Peet and B aren't the stealthiest of people, and when the guards come they decided to head back over to Trollskull Manor instead of causing any bother.

As B and Peet are walking back, Flank and Henry start talking to the investigator on the scene, **Barnibus Blastwind**, who also has a few questions for the party, as to him it seems the Gnome was trying to run into Trollskull Manor. The two say they've no idea who he is, or why he would be coming in, as they're not even open for business. Barnibus says Fine, and lets the players return to their manor. The party asks them if they're able to come and go as necessary, as they don't want to be confined to Trollskull Alley, and as they seem to have no involvement, Barnibus agrees. One of the guards then shouted over to Barnibus to asking for permission to let in people to take the bodies of the dead away, to the City of the Dead *[3]*

The party then follows Flank's lead by heading over to **The House Of Inspired Hands**, the local temple to the God **Gond**. As the party approaches, they see a figure on the roof, who raises an arm and releases a small bird, which does a few loops in the air and starts flying straight at the party. As the bird is roughly 60ft away, Henry pulls out his short bow and fires an arrow, however he misses the small target, B runs up the street, and Peet is holding fire to see what the bird actually does. The bird flies up and straight at Flank, imploding on his armor and knocking him back off his feet. They then enter the temple and are greeted by **Valetta**, a dragonborn priest here in the temple. They explain they they were just attacked by somebody on the roof of the temple, and Valetta sighs, and says "That must've been **Nim**" She then takes the party upstairs and introduces them to Nim, a numblewright construct. The party Discovers Nim had been creating toys for himself, to keep him occupied, however he had also created a few other Nimblewights. Nim seems to feel shame for what one of his creations has caused, and starts signing to Valetta that he might have something to help them catch the Nimblewright that did this. He hands them a tool, which when squeezed, the umbrella on top of it spins, and he explains to the party, by signing to Valetta, that it can be used to find other Nimblewrights. Nim then starts to sign something to the party, however Valetta ignores Nim [4] and explains to the party that if they find any other nimblewrights, there will be a reward if they can provide proof of destruction to Valetta.

She then explains to the party that a good place to start might be the **Dock Ward** as nimblewrights would probably be pretty cheap labour to some of the captains out there. 

The party now has a few options on where to go:  
The **Dock Ward** in search of the nimblewright that may have caused the explosion  
The **City of the Dead**, to find out what is happening with the corpses  
The party may know somebody who has had interactions with the **Zhents** and could know what they were doing in Trollskull Alley  

**[1]** I retconned the name of the Inn keepers guild guy just so I can keep track of it  
**[2]** The opera was actually sun in Giant, and was describing the fall of the evil dragon queen's defeat at the *Well Of Dragons*  
**[3]** I can't remember if this is how we introduced the concept of the City of the Dead, so this is how it is in canon now  
**[4]** The signing from Nim didn't happen at the time of play here.

Party was having brewskis in **The Yawning Portal** when a bald lad with eye tattoos on his head started a fight with a half orc by shouting "Like killin' my mates do ya?" at her. This caused the tavern to turn into a fighting pit between the bald lad and his four companions, and the half orc. After the two groups had been fighting for about 20 seconds, people from across the tavern started to shout for help and yelling that something was coming up the shaft in the centre of the tavern. **TROLL**, the party helped defend the tavern against the troll and 3 stirges, though B and Henry did go down during the fight, staff and patrons of The Yawning Portal helped get you back on your feet.

Once the troll had been defeated a scholarly looking man with a grey mustache and floppy hat approached the party, saying good job and thanking them for helping clearing out the troll. He introduced himself as **Volothamp Geddarm**, or Volo for short. He told the party that his pal had gone missing after they were drinking 2 nights ago, and that they seem like the kind of folk who could help him out. He offered them 10gp each if they'd help, and 10x that once they return. The party managed to get another 5 of that upfront, so 15 now, 95 later. He told them that they'd been drinking over at **The Skewered Dragon**, over in the Dock Ward when he last saw them, and Floon stayed after Volo had left.

As the party headed over to the Skewered Dragon, their path was blocked by the city guard cordoning off a road, laying on the cobblestones were 6 corpses, there were 3 blood drenched humans disarmed and arrested and a witness was being questioned, though the party was told to keep moving by the guard. As they neared the Skewered Dragon, they came across a peculiar "curiosity" shop, **Old Xoblob Shop**, which is ran by a bald gnome in plum robes, with eyes painted on his forehead, as well as there being a stuffed beholder in the window. Inside and out, everything was purple, even the smoke from the gnome's pipe. Henry bought a dead beetle scarab, and a vest with 100 tiny pockets while here. Xoblob mentioned to the party that they had seen two people matching Floon's description the be attacked by 5 guys in black leather armour outside the shop, one of them had a tattoo of a winged snake on his neck.

After leaving the shop the party continued up the street and ended up outside the Skewered Dragon, both its front windows smashed and a boats anchor sticking out of the roof. B decided to buy a round of ale for the party, downed his in immeasurable time, getting a round of applause from the lads a table over, and then going up to the bar keep to try finding out where Floon might've gotten to. The barkeep told him that him and a similar looking lad were here playing Three Dragon Ante two nights ago, and left around midnight, and it looked like a few of his patrons followed them out. One of the patrons piped up "They probably took him to the Warehouse on Candle Lane, just look for the one with the snake, you'll know it."

After heading to candle lane, which only had 1 lit candle, and it was opposite the warehouse, the party started to investigate outside, before slowly working their way inside, inside they came across 4 kenkus. B startled the kenkus by proclaiming they were tax collectors and had come to collect, to which the kenku drew their swords and attacked. After two kenku had died, the final two tried to retreat, one was left alive, and after being pressured by Henry, told the party "Xanathar sends its regards.", "Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!", "Follow the yellow signs in the sewers." and "No time to loot the place just get him to the boss." The warehouse itself had a dozen corpses, 5 Zhentarim, all with snake tattoos on their necks, and 7 Xanathar, one of whom had a tattoo of a circle and 10 spokes coming out of it on his palm.

After the party let the final Kenku go, Henry found a secret room in the warehouse, netting the party 15 10lb bars of silver, and 4 leather bound framed paintings, getting them about 525 gold. B, deciding it'd be a good time to impress the boys, decided to crash through the door to the closet under the stairs, letting a strong smell of pickled fish throughout the warehouse. B, thinking its floon, shouts at him, scaring the poor lad. It however isn't floon, its **Renaer Neverember**, noble in Waterdeep, and son of the former Open Lord Of Waterdeep. Before the party can learn too much about Renaer, the city guard intrude, and **Captain Staget** asks the party wtf is going on. Henry says they'd taken care of the Kenku here and they should receive a bounty, however, as they're with Renaer, their bounty is getting off with a warning, and to not meddle in criminal affairs in future and to leave the dirty business to the city guard.

The party then get a carriage back to The Yawning Portal, where they're met by Volo telling them they got the wrong lad, they tell him they're still working on it, and go to get food and chat to Ranaer. Ranaer tells them that the Zhentarim think his father had embezzled a large amount of gold while he was the Open Lord, and that he hid the gold somewhere in the city. They think the way to find the gold is with an artifact called the Stone of Golorr, which the Xanathar Guild had until recently. Apparently somebody had stolen it, and the zhents thought he would knew something about all of it, but he didnt, he hasnt even spoken to his father in years.

The party's next plan of action was to head down into the sewer hoping to find some way of finding Floon
